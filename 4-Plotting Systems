| In this lesson, we’ll give you a brief overview of the three plotting systems in R, their differences, strengths, and weaknesses. We’ll only cover the basics here to give
| you a general idea of the systems and in later lessons we’ll cover each system in more depth.

…

|========= | 5%
| The first plotting system is the Base Plotting System which comes with R. It’s the oldest system which uses a simple “Artist’s palette” model. What this means is that you
| start with a blank canvas and build your plot up from there, step by step.

…

|============= | 8%
| Usually you start with a plot function (or something similar), then you use annotation functions to add to or modify your plot. R provides many annotating functions such
| as text, lines, points, and axis. R provides documentation for each of these. They all add to an already existing plot.

…

|================== | 11%
| What do you think is a disadvantage of the Base Plotting System?

1: It’s intuitive and exploratory
2: You can’t go back once a plot has started
3: It mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
4: A complicated plot is a series of simple R commands

Selection: 2

| Perseverance, that’s the answer.

|====================== | 14%
| Yes! The base system is very intuitive and easy to use when you’re starting to do exploratory graphing and looking for a research direction. You can’t go backwards,
| though, say, if you need to readjust margins or fix a misspelled a caption. A finished plot will be a series of R commands, so it’s difficult to translate a finished plot
| into a different system.

…

|=========================== | 16%
| We’ve loaded the dataset cars for you to demonstrate how easy it is to plot. First, use the R command head with cars as an argument to see what the data looks like.

head(cars)
speed dist
1 4 2
2 4 10
3 7 4
4 7 22
5 8 16
6 9 10

| You got it!

|=============================== | 19%
| So the dataset collates the speeds and distances needed to stop for 50 cars. This data was recorded in the 1920’s.

…

|=================================== | 22%
| We’ll use the R command with which takes two arguments. The first specifies a dataset or environment in which to run the second argument, an R expression. This will save
| us a bit of typing. Try running the command with now using cars as the first argument and a call to plot as the second. The call to plot will take two arguments, speed and
| dist. Please specify them in that order.

with(cars,plot(speed,dist))

| Your dedication is inspiring!

|======================================== | 24%
| Simple, right? You can see the relationship between the two variables, speed and distance. The first variable is plotted along the x-axis and the second along the y-axis.

…

|============================================ | 27%
| Now we’ll show you what the function text does. Run the command text with three arguments. The first two, x and y coordinates, specify the placement of the third argument,
| the text to be added to the plot. Let the first argument be mean(cars$speed), the second max(cars$dist), and the third the string “SWIRL rules!”. Try it now.

text(mean(cars$speed),max(cars$dist),”SWIRL rules!”)
Warning messages:
1: In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) :
“string” is not a graphical parameter
2: In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) :
“string” is not a graphical parameter

| All that hard work is paying off!

|================================================= | 30%
| Ain’t it the truth?

…

|===================================================== | 32%
| Now we’ll move on to the second plotting system, the Lattice System which comes in the package of the same name. Unlike the Base
| System, lattice plots are created with a single function call such as xyplot or bwplot. Margins and spacing are set automatically
| because the entire plot is specified at once.

…

|========================================================== | 35%
| The lattice system is most useful for conditioning types of plots which display how y changes with x across levels of z. The variable
| z might be a categorical variable of your data. This system is also good for putting many plots on a screen at once.

…

|============================================================== | 38%
| The lattice system has several disadvantages. First, it is sometimes awkward to specify an entire plot in a single function call.
| Annotating a plot may not be especially intuitive. Second, using panel functions and subscripts is somewhat difficult and requires
| preparation. Finally, you cannot “add” to the plot once it is created as you can with the base system.

…

|================================================================== | 41%
| As before, we’ve loaded some data for you in the variable state. This data comes with the lattice package and it concerns various
| characteristics of the 50 states in the U.S. Use the R command head to see the first few entries of state now.

Colorado 2541 4884 0.7 72.06 6.8 63.9 166 103766 West

| That’s the answer I was looking for.

|======================================================================= | 43%
| As you can see state holds 9 pieces of information for each of the 50 states. The last variable, region, specifies a category for
| each state. Run the R command table with the argument state$region to see how many categories there are and how many states are in
| each.

table(state$region)

Northeast         South North Central          West 
        9            16            12            13 
| Nice work!

|=========================================================================== | 46%
| So there are 4 categories and the 50 states are sorted into them appropriately. Let’s use the lattice command xyplot to see how life
| expectancy varies with income in each of the four regions.

…

|================================================================================ | 49%
| To do this we’ll give xyplot 3 arguments. The first is the most complicated. It is this R formula, Life.Exp ~ Income | region, which
| indicates we’re plotting life expectancy as it depends on income for each region. The second argument, data, is set equal to state.
| This allows us to use “Life.Exp” and “Income” in the formula instead of specifying the dataset state for each term (as in
| state$Income). The third argument, layout, is set equal to the two-long vector c(4,1). Run xyplot now with these three arguments.

?xyplot
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout=c(4,1))

| You got it!

|==================================================================================== | 51%
| We see the data for each of the 4 regions plotted in one row. Based on this plot, which region of the U.S. seems to have the shortest
| life expectancy?

1: North Central
2: Northeast
3: West
4: South

Selection: 4

| You are doing so well!

|========================================================================================= | 54%
| Just for fun rerun the xyplot and this time set layout to the vector c(2,2). To save typing use the up arrow to recover the previous
| xyplot command.

xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout=c(2,2))

| You nailed it! Good job!

|============================================================================================= | 57%
| See how the plot changed? No need for you to worry about margins or labels. The package took care of all that for you.

…

|================================================================================================== | 59%
| Now for the last plotting system, ggplot2, which is a hybrid of the base and lattice systems. It automatically deals with spacing,
| text, titles (as Lattice does) but also allows you to annotate by “adding” to a plot (as Base does), so it’s the best of both worlds.

…

|====================================================================================================== | 62%
| Although ggplot2 bears a superficial similarity to lattice, it’s generally easier and more intuitive to use. Its default mode makes
| many choices for you but you can still customize a lot. The package is based on a “grammar of graphics” (hence the gg in the name),
| so you can control the aesthetics of your plots. For instance, you can plot conditioning graphs and panel plots as we did in the
| lattice example.

…

|========================================================================================================== | 65%
| We’ll see an example now of ggplot2 with a simple (single) command. As before, we’ve loaded a dataset for you from the ggplot2
| package. This mpg data holds fuel economy data between 1999 and 2008 for 38 different models of cars. Run head with mpg as an
| argument so you get an idea of what the data looks like.

head(mpg)

6 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 manual(m5) f 18 26 p compact

| Great job!

|=============================================================================================================== | 68%
| Looks complicated. Run dim with the argument mpg to see how big the dataset is.

dim(mpg)
[1] 234 11

| That’s the answer I was looking for.

|=================================================================================================================== | 70%
| Holy cow! That’s a lot of information for just 38 models of cars. Run the R command table with the argument mpg$model. This will tell
| us how many models of cars we’re dealing with.

| Oh, there are 38 models. We’re interested in the effect engine displacement (displ) has on highway gas mileage (hwy), so we’ll use
| the ggplot2 command qplot to display this relationship. Run qplot now with three arguments. The first two are the variables displ and
| hwy we want to plot, and the third is the argument data set equal to mpg. As before, this allows us to avoid using the mpg$variable
| notation for the first two arguments.

?qplot
qplot(displ,hwy,mpg)
Error: mapping must be created by aes()
qplot(displ,hwy,data=mpg)

| Nice work!

|============================================================================================================================ | 76%
| Not surprisingly we see that the bigger the engine displacement the lower the gas mileage.
